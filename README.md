# Dynamical_Systems_Lean
## Overview

The main aim of the project is to formalize the derivation of **Hamilton's equations of motion** from the **Lagrangian formulation** using **Lean 4**, following the presentation in *Goldstein's Classical Mechanics*, Chapter 8. 

Given the challenges in full generality due to many underlying assumptions like convexity of Lagrangian etc, we may focus on specific systems, such as the **harmonic oscillator**, to construct the Hamiltonian via the **Legendre transform** and proceed with the derivation.

## Goals
- Define the necessary mathematical structures in Lean 4.
- Formalize the **Euler-Lagrange equations** and the **Legendre transformation**.
- Derive **Hamiltonâ€™s equations** from the Lagrangian formulation.
- Explore feasibility and challenges of handling more general dynamical systems.
